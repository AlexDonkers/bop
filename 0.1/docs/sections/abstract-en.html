<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Building Performance Ontology (BOP) is a set of ontological constructs which allows integration of data related to building performance. By (re-)using ontology patterns from major ontologies in the field, BOP provides a method to integrate both static and dynamic (time-series) properties to buildings, zones, elements and products. 

It's aim is to facilitate building managers and facility managers with a common data structure to ease the process of data integration and to allow software tools to deal with the large heterogeneity of data. 

By (re-)using concepts from major ontologies in the field, BOP could easily be integrated with a wide range of existing ontologies and datasets. BOP could be seen as an extension of existing work rather than an individual ontology.</span>
